# Personal Projects

Welcome to my **Computer Science Personal Projects Repository**.

This repository contains projects I build while learning computer science, software engineering, and automation. The primary goal of this repo is to **train my engineering mindset**—specifically, to recognize everyday inefficiencies and design code-based solutions to eliminate or reduce them.

Rather than starting with abstract ideas, each project begins with a **real inconvenience or repetitive task** that I encounter in daily life. I document the problem, break it down into inputs, transformations, and outputs, and then implement an automated solution.

Each project focuses on:
- Applying core programming and computer science concepts
- Strengthening problem decomposition and systems thinking
- Writing maintainable, well-documented code
- Reflecting on design decisions and trade-offs

This repository represents my ongoing progression from learning syntax to building practical, reusable software systems.
