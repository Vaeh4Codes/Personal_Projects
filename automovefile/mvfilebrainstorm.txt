Inconvenience: moving a file to another location in command line 

[A] I want a program that takes a file input and moves it to another location

[U]  Done = in command line i can input  files and output locations, and the file is automatically moved
    MVP = in command line i can ONE input a file and ONE output location, and the file is automatically moved

[T] Input = the file I specify
    Transform:
    Outputs: file is moved to appropriate location, and success or failure statement is printed

[O] 
    1. Ask for file input via command line
    2. Search file system for file/ check if exits
        - If dosn’t exist return error message via command line
    3.Find and store full path of the file
    4. Ask for file destination via command line
    5. If necessary find full path of the destination 
    6. Check if destination path exists
        - If dosn’t exist return error message via command line
    7. Move file to destination path
    8. Print success statement or failure statement
    9. End
