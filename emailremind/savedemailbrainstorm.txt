Steps

1. Create a system that pulls and organizes emails in stared folder (using SqLite)
  - Design sqlLite database schema for messages pulled from stared inbox
  - Map Gmail concepts to your schema
  - Create an ingestion syncing loop
  - Query gmail for stared messages
  - Fetch full metadata for each message
  - Deduplicate + upsert (so you can run it daily safely)
  - Store raw + normalized data (two-layer storage)
  - Keep a sync cursor (so you don’t fetch everything every time
